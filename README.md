## How it works

[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/1398866a049f42dda577eb1f33e417b8)](https://app.codacy.com/app/krmax44/Playify?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=krmax44/Playify&utm_campaign=Badge_Grade_Dashboard)


It's simple. You click on a Spotify link, and it opens in your streaming service of choice. For the best experience, the [Google Play Music Desktop Player](https://googleplaymusicdesktopplayer.com) is recommended. If you don't want to open a song in Spotify, add `#no-playify` at the end of the URL.

### GPMDP

To use the Google Play Music Desktop Player, click on the Playify icon in the Chrome Toolbar and select `Google Play Music Desktop Player`. The next time you open a Spotify link, Playify will prompt you to enter a four-digit code that will be displayed in GPMDP. Notice that GPMDP must be running in the background and the Playback API (Websocket API) needs to be enabled.

### Transfer playlists

You can find more information about transfering playlists with Playify [here](https://github.com/krmax44/Playify-Transfer/blob/master/README.md#playify-transfer).
